Install Instructions: (Read carefully!)

1. Disable your Network connection or pull the network cable.
   (optional) And make sure you dont have any of those entries in your hosts file:

   127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
   127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com

   Lets start clean :)

2. Open the Keymaker. You can find it under the name "xf-mccs6" as RAR-file in the 
   folder "Crack-Windows".
   ( Do not close the program!)

3. Run the "Set-up.exe" file. It is in the folder "MasterCollection_CS6_LS16" in the sub-folder "Adobe CS6".
   When Adobe asks if you want to install or test, choose install.

4. Copy the generated serial code "Serial" from the keymaker to adobe.
   When the error "Please connect to the internet and retry" shows click connect later.

5. Launch one of the Adobe programs (Photoshop, Illustrator etc).

6. Confirm you have a "connection problem" and you want it to
   activate offline.

7. A request code will be generated by Adobe. Use it with the serial you used to install adobe 
   to generate your activation code.
   Copy it to the field "Request" in the keymaker and click "Generate".

8. Copy this to adobe and Validate it of course :).

9. When installation is finished: 
   Execute  "disable_activation.cmd" in the folder "Crack-Windows" (doubleclick on it). 
   (in Vista or Win7, run it as admin if you have uac enabled)

   Or do it manually 
   Add the text below to the bottom (!) of your hosts file. 
   (The host file is located C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)

# Adobe Blocker

127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com


10. After it has been activated re-enable your Network connection and close the keymaker.

11. Finished. Enjoy the Adobe programs!


Note: If you encounter any issues with a previous installation / crack, please
uninstall Master collection and delete those folders :
